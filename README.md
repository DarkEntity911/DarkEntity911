# 💫 About Me:
I am a passionate developer focused on creating immersive digital experiences. My journey in game development began with the creation of a 2D game using Python and Pygame, where I learned the fundamentals of physics, sprite animation, and game logic. Currently, I am expanding my portfolio with new game projects, utilizing my skills in C++ and C# to build more complex and engaging mechanics. 
Beyond coding, I am a dedicated contributor to the tech ecosystem. I have a strong foundation in Python, C++, C#, and MySQL, allowing me to bridge the gap between creative game design and robust backend data management. 
Leadership & Community Impact:
I believe in the power of community. My experience as a Campus Ambassador allowed me to bridge the gap between industry and academia. Currently, I serve as a Core Team Member of the Google Developer Groups (GDG) on campus, where I help foster a culture of learning and innovation. My commitment to the developer community is further reflected in my role as a volunteer for GDG Gwalior, recognized by Google. 
Certifications & Open Source:
I am a lifelong learner with a track record of excellence, holding certifications from:
Google (GDG Volunteer Recognition)
GSSoC (GirlScript Summer of Code)
Internshala
LetsUpgrade
PeerHub
I am always looking for opportunities to collaborate on innovative game projects or community-driven tech initiatives.
